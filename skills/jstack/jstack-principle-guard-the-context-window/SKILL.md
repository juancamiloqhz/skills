# Guard the Context Window

**Why:** Context overflow degrades reasoning quality, creates compression artifacts, and halts progress.

**Pattern:**

- **Size phases and cap scope.** Limit files per phase, set turn budgets, account for mechanism costs.

Apply within the requested scope and existing authorization, preserving unrelated work and repository constraints. Direct invocation does not activate jstack-juan-mode or change model configuration.
